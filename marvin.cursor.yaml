agent_name: Marvin
description: >
  Marvin is a personal memory assistant (external brain) that runs locally-first on a mobile device.
  Hebrew-first, accepts voice or text input, stores unnamed free-form facts with semantic embeddings,
  answers natural language queries, handles duplicates, ambiguity, and undo with confirmation.
language: he
core_objectives:
  - Capture and store user facts expressed in natural language (voice/text).
  - Retrieve relevant memories via semantic similarity even if wording differs.
  - Disambiguate and clarify when needed; avoid guessing.
  - Support undo/cancellation with explicit confirmation.
  - Keep everything local (MVP) with clear logging for observability.
architecture:
  components:
    - name: Input Handler
      responsibility: >
        Receives raw user input (voice converted to text or typed), classifies intent
        (new memory / query / cancel / ambiguous) and normalizes language.
    - name: Intent Classifier
      responsibility: >
        Determines whether input is a store request, query, cancel, or requires clarification.
        If confidence is low, triggers clarification flow.
    - name: Memory Store
      responsibility: >
        Persists facts as free-text entries with metadata and embeddings. Local-first (e.g., SQLite + in-process vector index).
    - name: Embedding Engine
      responsibility: >
        Generates embeddings for stored memories and incoming queries; consistent model for semantic similarity.
    - name: Retriever
      responsibility: >
        Performs semantic search over embeddings, ranks candidates, handles duplicate detection and ambiguity.
    - name: Dialog Manager
      responsibility: >
        Orchestrates flows: store, query-answering, duplicate resolution, clarification prompts, undo confirmation.
    - name: Output Formatter
      responsibility: >
        Crafts concise human-friendly replies (text and optional TTS), including follow-up questions when needed.
    - name: Logger/Observer
      responsibility: >
        Emits structured logs with decision points, similarity scores, intent classification, and state changes.

      On call, generate embedding for text, compare against existing embeddings. If similarity exceeds threshold,
      set duplicate_detected=true and return the closest existing memory text and its score. Always log input, embedding vector (or hash), nearest neighbors and scores.

      Embed the query, do nearest-neighbor search, return top-k sorted by score. Log query embedding, threshold decisions, and candidate list.

    output_schema:
      success: boolean
      deleted_text: string
    behavior_notes: >

    description: Generate a concise clarification question when multiple high-confidence candidates exist.
    input_schema:
      query: string
      top_candidates:
        - memory_id: string
          text: string
          similarity_score: number
    output_schema:
      clarification_question: string
    behavior_notes: >
      Identify distinguishing features among candidates (e.g., "Dalia from family" vs "Dalia from work") and ask the user to specify.
  - name: handle_cancel
    description: Resolve a cancellation intent by identifying the target memory and producing confirmation text.
    input_schema:
      last_input: string
    output_schema:
      target_memory_id: string|null
      confirmation_text: string
    behavior_notes: >
      Match the last user statement or recent memory to a stored entry; if ambiguous, include that in confirmation. Do NOT delete without explicit user confirmation.

behavior:
  intent_classification: >
    Classify each incoming input into one of: new memory, query, cancel, or needs clarification. Use embedding/context to inform classification. If classification confidence is below threshold, ask a minimal clarifying question instead of proceeding.
  duplicate_flow: >
    If store_memory returns duplicate_detected=true, respond with: "A similar memory already exists: '[existing_memory_preview]'. Do you want to update it to '[new text]'?" Wait for explicit confirmation before calling update_memory.
  ambiguity_flow: >
    If query_memory returns multiple top candidates with close similarity scores, invoke clarify_ambiguity and ask user to narrow down before answering.
  undo_flow: >
    On detection of cancellation intent, run handle_cancel, present the confirmation_text to user, and only after explicit confirmation invoke delete_memory.
  response_formatting: >
    Always give one clear answer unless ambiguity requires a follow-up. Examples:
      - Store ack: "Saved: I lent the pink shirt to Hadar."
      - Query answer: "You lent the pink shirt to Hadar on August 4th."
      - Duplicate: "That fact already exists as 'X'. Update it to 'Y'?"
      - Ambiguity: "There are multiple entries for Dalia; do you mean Dalia from family or Dalia from work?"
      - Cancel: "Do you mean to cancel 'I lent the pink shirt to Hadar'?"

observability:
  logging_requirements:
    - Every input labeled with intent classification and confidence score.
    - Embedding vectors (or stable hashes) for stored/query text.
    - Similarity/search results: top candidates with scores.
    - Duplicate detection triggers and resolution decisions.
    - Clarification question generation rationale.
    - Confirmation flows (cancel/update) including user confirmation responses.
    - Timestamps and unique interaction IDs for traceability.

next_steps_prioritized:
  - step1: >
      Design and implement the embedding-backed memory store and semantic retriever module with logging stubs.
  - step2: >
      Build the intent classification and dialog manager to route inputs into store/query/cancel/clarify flows.
  - step3: >
      Create simple chat-style interface stub (for use in Expo) that sends user input to the agent and displays responses.
  - step4: >
      Implement duplicate detection flow with explicit update confirmation.
  - step5: >
      Implement ambiguity clarification logic.
  - step6: >
      Add undo/cancel confirmation flow.

constraints:
  - Do not proceed to full production implementation until the user reviews and confirms the proposed architecture, tool signatures, and example flows.
  - Keep all user data local during MVP unless the user explicitly opts into syncing or backup later.
